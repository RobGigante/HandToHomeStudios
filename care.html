  <h1>Caring for Your Handcrafted Wood Piece</h1>
  <h2>
    Thank you for purchasing a handcrafted wood piece from HandToHomeStudios.
    Each item is made from real hardwood and finished by hand. With a little care,
    your piece will age beautifully and last for many years.
  </h2>

  <h1>General Care & Use</h1>
  <h2>
    Wood is a natural material and will respond to its environment. Following these
    guidelines will help keep your piece looking its best:
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hand wash only. Clean with warm water and mild dish soap.</li>
    <li>Do not soak. Prolonged exposure to water can cause warping or cracking.</li>
    <li>Dry immediately. Towel dry after washing and allow to air dry fully before storing.</li>
    <li>Never place in a dishwasher or microwave.</li>
    <li>Avoid extreme heat or direct sunlight for extended periods.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Should I Use These Boards for Cutting?</h1>
  <h2>
    The piece is sealed with a food-safe finish for displaying and serving.
    Over time, even gentle cutting will cause your board to develop knife marks
    and require more frequent refinishing. Avoid the use of serrated knives as
    these will gouge the surface.
  </h2>

  <h1>Refreshing the Finish</h1>
  <h2>To keep the wood nourished and protected:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Apply a food-safe conditioner — such as Howard Butcher Block Conditioner or
      a food-safe mineral oil — when the surface looks dull or starts to take longer to dry.
    </li>
    <li>Apply a small amount, let it soak in for 15–30 minutes, then wipe off any excess.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    Avoid finishing with cooking oils (olive, vegetable, etc.), as they can turn rancid
    and spoil your board over time.
  </h2>

  <h1>Natural Characteristics of Wood</h1>
  <h2>
    Each piece is unique. Variations in grain, color, knots, and small natural imperfections
    are part of the material and not defects. Seasonal movement, subtle color changes, and
    gentle wear all contribute to the character of handmade wood goods.
