  <h1>Caring for Your Handcrafted Charcuterie Board or Display Riser</h1>
  <h2>
    Thank you for purchasing a handcrafted wood piece from HandToHomeStudios.
    Each item is made from real hardwood and finalized by hand with food finishes to give you piece of mind. 
    With a little care, your piece will age beautifully and last for many years.
  </h2>


  <h1>Natural Characteristics of Wood</h1>
  <h2>
    Each piece is unique. Variations in grain, color, knots, and small natural imperfections
    add to its character and are not defects. Seasonal movement, subtle color changes, and
    gentle wear all contribute to the character of handmade wood products.
  </h2>



  <h1>General Care & Use</h1>
  <h2>
    Wood is a natural material that responds to environment and is effected by use. 
    Following these guidelines will help keep your piece looking its best:
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hand wash only with warm water and with a mild dish soap if needed.</li>
    <li>Towel dry immediately and stand the board upright to air out until fully dry before storing.</li>
    <li>Do not soak or submerge the item as prolonged exposure to water can cause warping or cracking.</li>
    <li>Never place in a dishwasher or microwave.</li>
    <li>Avoid extreme heat or direct sunlight for extended periods.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Can I Use Mine as a Cutting Board or a Trivet?</h1>
  <h2>
    Over time, even gentle cutting will necessitate more frequent refreshing and cause knife marks that cannot be removed.  
    If you do decide to use them for cutting, avoid the use of serrated knifes as these will tear and gouge the wood fibers.
    The food safe finish will not protect against the extreme heat of cookware and may result in burning, cracking or warping.    
  </h2>

  <h1>Refreshing the Finish</h1>
  <h2>To keep the wood nourished and protected:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When the surface looks dull or you notice that the piece is taking longer to dry, it is time to refresh the finish.</li>
    <li>Use a food-safe conditioner — such as Howard Butcher Block Conditioner or a food safe mineral oil.</l1> 
    <li>Apply to all surfaces with soft clean rag. After 15-30 minutes wipe off the excess with a soft dry rag.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    Avoid finishing with cooking oils (olive, vegetable, etc.), as they can turn rancid and spoil your board over time.
